# üîí Security Guidelines

## Docker Security Best Practices

### 1. Build Security

#### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
- Use BuildKit secrets for sensitive data during build
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use specific image tags instead of `latest`

#### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Never copy `.env`, `.git/`, `id_rsa*`, `node_modules/` into images
- Don't use `ARG` or `ENV` for secrets (visible in `docker history`)
- Don't run containers as root unless absolutely necessary
- Don't mount Docker socket unless trusted

### 2. Runtime Security

#### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use Docker Compose secrets for sensitive data
- Mount secrets as files, not environment variables
- Use read-only filesystems where possible
- Limit container capabilities
- Use health checks

#### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Don't pass secrets via CLI arguments
- Don't log sensitive information
- Don't use privileged containers unless necessary
- Don't expose unnecessary ports

### 3. Registry Security

#### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use private registries for production
- Sign images with Docker Content Trust
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use image retention policies
- Rotate secrets regularly

#### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Don't push images with secrets to public registries
- Don't use untrusted base images
- Don't ignore security scan results

## Quick Security Checklist

Before pushing any image:

- [ ] `.dockerignore` excludes sensitive files
- [ ] Multi-stage build used
- [ ] No secrets in `ARG`/`ENV`
- [ ] Non-root user specified
- [ ] Image scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] No unnecessary privileges
- [ ] Secrets managed properly

## Tools Used

- **BuildKit**: For secure secret handling during build
- **Trivy**: For vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Content Trust**: For image signing
- **Multi-stage builds**: For minimal attack surface

## Scripts

- `scripts/setup-secrets.sh`: Setup secrets directory
- `scripts/build-secure.sh`: Build images securely
- `scripts/security-audit.sh`: Audit security configuration

## Emergency Response

If secrets are compromised:

1. Rotate all affected secrets immediately
2. Rebuild and redeploy all affected images
3. Review access logs
4. Update security policies
5. Conduct security review
